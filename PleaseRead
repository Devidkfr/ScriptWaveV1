This is not skidded but instead made by me! It's a trash gui made really easily.

It trash hence why it's for low unc executors it might no longer support low unc executors like jjsploit but supports a better low unc executors.


There is a private version in progress but that laterrr. (This is work in proggress)

I will also be changing the name of this to trash to somthing else later

I revamped the script, So we are now going from roblox studio to RayField studio

I used Visual Studio code to fully script this. I have tested it so Ik it works.

Supported executor so far are Synapes z, Wave, Salad(i think), and Zorara or any private high unc Executors.
