This is not skidded but instead made by me! It's a ScriptWave gui made In 1-2 Hours.

 it's for low unc executors it might no longer support low unc executors like jjsploit but supports a better low unc executors.


There is a private version in progress but that is now!?

I revamped the script, So we are now going from roblox studio to Visual Studo Code studio (It used to be Trashv1 and we used roblox studio but now we are using Visual Studo Code)

I used Visual Studio code to fully script this. I have tested it so Ik it works.

Supported executor so far are Synapes z, Wave, Salad(i think), and Zorara or any private high unc Executors.


Unforunatly Loadstrings dont work currently, Fix hopefully soon.
